"They don't do any damn more molding at Pencey than they do at any other school. And I didn't know anybody there that was splendid and clear-thinking and all. Maybe two guys. If that many. And they probably came to Pencey that way.",

"I got the ax. They give guys the ax quite frequently at Pencey. It has a very good academic rating, Pencey. It really does.",

"What I was really hanging around for, I was trying to feel some kind of a good-by. I mean I've left schools and places I didn't even know I was leaving them. I hate that. I don't care if it's a sad good-by or a bad good-by, but when I leave a place I like to know I'm leaving it. If you don't, you feel even worse.",

"It was that kind of a crazy afternoon, terrifically cold, and no sun out or anything, and you felt like you were disappearing every time you crossed a road.",

"Quite a few guys came from these wealthy families, but it was full of crooks anyway. The more expensive a school is, the more crooks it has.",

"They're quite touchy about anything like that, especially my father. They're nice and all-I'm not saying that-but they're also touchy as hell.",

"Charlotte once ran away from me, outside the studio, and I grabbed her dress to stop her, to keep her near me. A yellow cotton dress I loved because it was too long for her.",

"I was not only twenty-three, but a conspicuously retarded twenty-three.",

"How terrible it is when you say I love you and the person on the other end shouts back 'What?'",

"I'm a kind of paranoiac in reverse. I suspect people of plotting to make me happy.",

"The human voice conspires to desecrate everything on Earth.",

"Marriage partners are to serve each other. Elevate, help, teach, strengthen each other, but above all, serve.",

"I have scars on my hands from touching certain people.",

"The true poet has no choice of material. The material plainly chooses him, not he it."
